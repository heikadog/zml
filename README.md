# Laelaps/Zoophile Mute List GitHub Repo

The Laelaps labeller and its associated moderation lists for Bluesky (the Laelaps moderation lists and the Zoophile Mute List by heikadog) encompasses zoophiles and people who actively interact with or support them. This README serves as a directory of sorts, so everything associated with Laelaps and the Zoophile Mute List is readily accessible. Navigate using the links below.

View and subscribe to the Laelaps labeller: <https://laelaps.fyi>.

To mute or block the accounts on a Laelaps moderation list, select one of the links below and select "Subscribe" at the upper-right corner of the list page. When you subscribe to the list, accounts on the list will have a disclaimer below their profile that says they're muted or blocked by the list. To share the list in question, select the arrow to the right of the Subscribe button.

## Directory

- Read the evidence: <https://info.laelaps.fyi>.
- To report an account to be labelled, follow these instructions: (<https://bsky.app/profile/laelaps.fyi/post/3ky4mvys7qkq3>).
  - For more complex issues, you can submit accounts to be labelled, appeal a label, or submit feedback here: <https://form.laelaps.fyi>.

Because there's already an in-app reporting process and a form to submit accounts to the labeller and appeal a label, don't submit them as a pull request. Instead, report or appeal labels in the app or at <https://form.laelaps.fyi>. This way, we can ensure your response is kept confidential and we can get as much information as possible. Only submit a pull request if you have a suggestion or fix for this GitHub repo itself.
