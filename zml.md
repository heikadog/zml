To be labelled, candidates should meet at least one or more of these criteria:

1. Publicly identifying as a zoophile. This includes profiles with known coded dogwhistles like the Greek letter zeta (Œ∂), the triangles and four-pointed star (‚ó§‚ú¶‚ó¢), or the Phoenician aleph (ê§Ä), or having a handle that's linked to a zoophile-centric domain name.
2. Actively interacting with open zoophiles. This includes, but is not limited to: liking or reposting posts related to, replying to, or following a large number of open zoophiles.
3. Supporting or defending zoophiles or their associates, or creating spaces that welcome zoophiles.
4. Being publicly identified as a zoophile by a reputable whistleblower, or being found participating in conversations which advocate for or admit to zoophilic acts.

Some additional information:

- We don't label accounts based on our own personal, subjective beliefs or standards. Suspicions, feelings that an account is "probably" eligible, or otherwise inferred judgements alone do not meet our aforementioned criteria. Even if we're convinced someone is a zoophile or actively interacts with them, we don't add accounts unless we can present sufficient evidence.
- It's important to note that simply following or occasionally interacting with an alleged zoophile is not enough to be labelled. When it comes to accounts who are accused of actively interacting with zoophiles, we look for a clear, habitual pattern of one or more of the above criteria before we add them.
- Certain groups within the furry community are often falsely deemed to be zoophiles, and we don't want to contribute to that stigma. For example, even though we don't personally condone feral NSFW, creating or supporting feral NSFW does not stand on its own as sufficient evidence to deem someone a zoophile. In a similar vein, identifying as a therian does not stand on its own as sufficient evidence to deem someone a zoophile. While zoophiles have used these labels to cover for themselves, we require more concrete proof before making any judgements.
- The evidence document occasionally sources from whistleblowers who specialize in reporting on zoophilia, like ExposeTheFV and ConStaffWatch. We've gone on record to call these accounts "reputable whistleblowers," even carving out criteria in the evidence document for these accounts. We define a "reputable" whistleblower as an account with a proven track record of gathering and presenting strong, verifiable evidence related to zoophiles, such as archived snapshots of websites or screenshots they take themselves. Additionally, whistleblowers we cite in the evidence document have demonstrated a nuanced understanding of paraphilias, accurately and reliably reporting on harmful individuals while also placing an emphasis on harm reduction. And, if and when they make an error-in-fact, they have also issued retractions.
- In the event that we deem an account harmful for our users, the Laelaps team will occassionally make an executive decision to hide an account for its users, replacing the account with a Content Blocked screen. When we do this, we'll post about it on Bluesky and provide an explanation for why we hid the account in question both in the post and in the evidence document. _[This policy does not apply to accounts that violate Bluesky's Community Guidelines‚Äîwe still responsibly report those accounts.]_
- All relevant links to evidence are archived on <https://archive.today> in the event that they go down or change for any reason. We also make a deliberate effort to capture our own high-quality screenshots instead of sourcing them from elsewhere.

These stipulations prevent innocent people from being unfairly labelled, as we're aware these are serious accusations that can ruin a person's reputation and should not be taken lightly.

## Evidence

> [!CAUTION]
> Some of these links include censored, but still explicit animal sexual abuse media or animal genitalia‚Äîproceed with caution.

1. (For the sake of brevity in this subsection, we're only focusing on people with Bluesky accounts. Assume fully censored or blacked-out screenshots in the thread to be explicit animal sexual abuse media‚Äîthese are not blank tweets.)

   - On July 2nd, 2023, Cael (@cael.tech/@murrsuit.ing), Abra Heron (@abra.anthro.place/@abra.sheath.pics), and Brick (@doggy.ws/@ad.doggy.ws) were all implicated in following and actively interacting with a zoophile, privated Twitter user @olHowlnGrowl. According to whistleblower @ExposeTheFV, this account only posts explicit animal sexual abuse media. (<https://archive.today/hRLCI>).
   - The zoophile in question directly encourages and supports animal sexual abuse, even going so far as to post a video of the act, a post which Brick was screenshotted liking on their AD. (<https://archive.today/DcxBf>). The year of the post is partially obscured in the original screenshot, but according to @ExposeTheFV in a separate reply, this video was posted on June 29th, 2023. (<https://archive.today/HvFrE>).
   - Abra liked animal sexual abuse media with the caption "Huskies ‚ô• üåπ:" (<https://archive.today/aBtqx>). Both Cael and Abra liked a post which applied a sexual innuendo to animals at FWA 2023: (<https://archive.today/Roml4>).
   - Cael liked a post from the zoophile complaining about "the account with the good dog dick photos" getting suspended:" (<https://archive.today/Roml4>).
   - Linkin Monroe/Bad Doberman (@linkinmonroe.bsky.social) was seen following the same privated zoophile account that Cael, Abra, Brick, and Anubis Coyote were all interacting with: (<https://archive.today/oq2aO>).

1. _[CW for realistic depictions of animal genitalia and explicit nudes. The Telegram link provided here also has screen recordings of select tweets in addition to screenshots.]_
   AkariHusky (@akarihusky.feral.army) has a large amount of evidence against him, most of which can be viewed here if you have Telegram: (<https://t.me/AkariHuskyZoophile>). Along with directly supporting zoophilia and being an open zoophile for years, Akari also had an AD dedicated to his dog where he posted explicit animal sexual abuse media of the dog. In 2015, he said in a reply that he "wouldn't wish being zoo upon anyone," direct confirmation that he is a zoophile.
1. _[CW in the first link for explicit nudes and censored animal sexual abuse media.]_
   Among other actions, like calling holding people accountable for zoophilia an "SJW crusade," and liking a post on his AD which linked to a peer-to-peer mirror of animal sexual abuse media in 2013: (<https://twitter.com/itsjustathingy/status/1406230343426977793>), Cenny (@cenny.bsky.social/@cennyad.bsky.social) had the zeta symbol in his bio in 2016: (<https://archive.today/mHg4g>) and was caught liking explicit animal sexual abuse media on his AD: (<https://archive.today/r23Vm>). In addition, he was explicitly mentioned to be a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks in 2017: (<https://archive.today/zlA4O>).
1. Papa Rhino (@paparhino.dad/@papamord.bsky.social) is a zoophile. I worked on an outing about him with reputable whistleblower ExposeTheFV, linking him to his alt, JDonk (@zooeydonk.bsky.social) _[Now suspended, but leaving here for reference.]_, and showing he's a zoophile (and has publicly interacted with minors as young as 14): (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1730851018416771097>). He even liked a reply to JDonk's tweet _about_ JDonk being Rhino: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1730851024393691197>).
1. Soren (@feral4feral.art) is an open zoophile.
1. Lukar (@lukar.feral.army) follows and interacts with open zoophiles: (<https://archive.today/NNeP5>).
1. Kaptain (@kaptain.dog) was found openly harboring zoophiles in a DM and called people holding zoophiles accountable "a witch hunt," in addition to interacting with Cenny's AD. (<https://archive.today/N7xYv>).
1. Huskeee (@huskeee.bsky.social) and ZoobyDoobyDoo (@zoobydoobydoo.bsky.social) are both open zoophiles who requested to be listed: (1: <https://archive.today/SYyUF> / 2: <https://archive.today/wtdxo>).
1. Akito (@akito.zooand.me) hosts a zoophile podcast and is an open zoophile: (<https://archive.today/FFb0z>).
1. ~~ZooFur Faction (@zoo.pics) posts explicit images of IRL animal genitalia.~~ We've gotten this account taken down. To anyone who reported them or shared a post calling for them to be reported, thank you! üéâ
1. 007bistromath (@007bistromath.bsky.social), Vex (@koolkanine.zooand.me), Ceres Fallen (@ceresfallen.bsky.social), and Akkuriss (@akkuriss.bsky.social) are open zoophiles.
1. Tundru (@tundru.bsky.social/@tundruad.bsky.social) has implied that hating zoophiles is "childish," according to a reply they made to an open zoophile on Twitter: (<https://archive.today/LnsoX>), and deflected confrontations about other known zoophiles to conversations about feral porn when the actual conversation is not strictly about that. This isn't why we labelled the account, but for context, a user being called out, while not having a Bluesky account, commissioned porn of their dog being sexually abused by their OC. In this instance, this is distinguishable from normal feral porn because it referenced their real-life dog: (<https://archive.today/t99pQ>).
1. Milk (@championwhoops.zooand.me), Tarminac (@tarminac.bsky.social), Puppyboi (@st1ckyp4rts.bsky.social), Zedderchee (@zedderchee.bsky.social/@zedderad.bsky.social), and DotaWolf (@dotawolf.bsky.social) are open zoophiles.

1. Simba, the owner of furry community Discord server Furry Valley (@furryvalley.bsky.social), is a documented zoosadist: (<https://archive.today/24IAU>) and has been documented following zoophiles on the main Furry Valley Twitter as recently as 2021: (<https://archive.today/PBv9o>).
1. In a Telegram message from 2017, Rayne (@acidraincloud.bsky.social) admitted to sexually abusing and killing live fish with their partner Teriyakii (@teriyaki.bsky.social) as ‚Äúa kink:‚Äù (<https://archive.today/kZYww>). Both have since privated their accounts. Video proof that the messages are real: (<https://archive.ph/uO8uK>).
1. Matuska (@matuska.bsky.social) has publicly stated they don't condone IRL zoophilia on their feral account, but they listed themselves as a zoophile in 2019: (<https://archive.today/NtDFK>).
1. ZoophileW/GuruminYT (@zoophilew.bsky.social/gurumin.bsky.social) has interacted with Tarro on Twitter: (<https://archive.today/jugl2>) and admitted to FluffyPaws, one of the people who runs the account, being a minor: (<https://archive.today/5380E>). They've also said they're "not going to get away from the zoo community": (<https://archive.today/aYIZL>).
1. Several people submitted to the Laelaps/Zoophile Mute List Form were implicated in or linked to the SnakeThing/Kero/Tane leaks:

   1. Paradox Wolf (@ctcwired.paradoxwolf.info) tweeted about zoophilia several times from 2014 to 2017: (<https://archive.today/5IG26>), tweeted about being "an ally" in 2017: (<https://archive.today/ushQa>), and as far back as 2018 they had it in their AD's bio: (<https://archive.today/zgEg3>). They also condemned calling Kero a zoosadist: (<https://archive.today/ilWtO>). Additional screenshots of Paradox being an apologist for zoophilia: (<https://archive.today/4PQ0t>).
   2. Anubis Coyote (@yotepa.ws) was found liking explicit animal sexual abuse media from @olHowlnGrowl in 2023: (<https://archive.today/3Xv1j>). He let a dog mount him: _[CW for censored animal sexual abuse media.]_ (<https://archive.today/6ySOP>). He was also mentioned in the zoosadism leaks as being a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and follows several outed zoophiles. Additionally, he liked a post from open zoophile Huskeee about non-verbal communication (i.e., a way to justify them sexually abusing dogs): (<https://archive.today/YklLL>).
   3. Philly Satark (@purple-slutsky.com) was mentioned as being a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). They were additionally found to have participated in another zoophile Telegram group: (<https://archive.today/rKfr2>). The person who made their suit, jessefrost / frosstfursuits, openly associates with Cenny as well (this is a thread): (<https://twitter.com/carnalcove/status/1500755885081120770>).
   4. Stormy (@stormycat.xyz) has openly admitted to being a zoophile and having sex with animals: (<https://archive.today/jGTch>) and was named in the zoosadist leaks by SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). When they were called out on it in 2018, they downplayed what happened as "[watching] the community take a shit on you over what you did as a teenager" and said the fandom was toxic (<https://archive.today/Q2qMu>). In addition, Cenny defended Stormy publicly after Cenny was criticized for associating with him: (<https://archive.today/Lswki>).
   5. Tekkita (@ak1tap0wer.bsky.social) was implicated in the zoosadist leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and was part of a plot to assault someone who pressed charges against their associates: (<https://dogpatch.press/2019/09/16/crime-ring-zoosadist>). Tekkita dated Cupid the Deer, a convicted zoosadist and pedophile: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction>). He claimed he was going to borrow a dog from Cupid and discussed possessing "gorey rough videos" with known zoosadist SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/Mcv6e>). Additionally, he was seen in 2019 hanging out with Akari, apparently his boyfriend at the time: (<https://twitter.com/forgifuzzbutt/status/1114218195907416065>) _[Tekkita's Bluesky account has since been deleted, but we've decided to keep this entry in the document since Tekkita is an important figure in the zoosadist leaks.]_
   6. Rai Dawg (@raidawghusky.bsky.social) dated Cupid the Deer, a convicted zoosadist and pedophile, for over three years: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction/>). And in 2022, he defended Cupid in court: (<https://archive.today/PGpA0>).

      > In an earlier version of this document, we were of the opinion that Mr. Bitchtits was Rai, and another common theory in anti-zoophile circles was that Mr. Bitchtits was a shared account. However, external research instead confirmed that the person running the Mr. Bitchtits account arranged to make animal sexual abuse media, that there was a matching video of evidence including Tekkita's suit, and the date the file was created is the day after he discussed borrowing a dog from Cupid in the logs. Therefore, we've deduced that Tekkita is the sole owner of the account, _not_ Rai. However, due to his proximity to Cupid and other known zoophiles, we've decided to keep Rai labelled.

   7. postaldog94 (@postaldog94.bsky.social) is a registered sex offender who was mentioned as wanting to assault puppies with SnakeThing. These logs also connect him with Akari and Tekkita _[CW for NSFL conversations.]_ (<https://archive.today/J8KqY>).

In the leaks, there are pictures of him and another person sexually abusing a dog: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682162998944075>). And the side, front, and back views of the suit line up with the suit in the pictures of the abuse, confirming it's him: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682169147777084> / <https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682171131646228>).

1. Hypnotist Sappho (@hypnotist-sappho.bsky.social) is an open zoophile and pedophile, but we believe this Bluesky account is LARPing as her. Initially, the account claimed to be squatting the username to prevent Sappho from reclaiming it if they tried to come back to the furry community. However, the owner of the account later deleted this clarification, effectively turning it into a troll account roleplaying as a zoophile and pedophile: (<https://archive.ph/siejH>). They later made posts with captions like "rules were made to be broken (laws too):" (<https://archive.ph/o8tOw>) and replies with captions like "maybe I'm her, maybe I'm not:" (<https://archive.ph/W5kQk>). If you're going to squat a username so a bad actor can't take it, there should be some permanent, accessible notice of that; roleplaying as an outed zoophile and pedophile doesn't assist the anti-zoo movement in any way. TLDR: We don't believe this is the real Sappho, but the fact that this account no longer has a clarification we can point to that explicitly says they're not the real Sappho can potentially lead to real harm and confusion.

1. OllieOops/ArtsyPawz (@artsypawz.bsky.social/@xenocanidae.bsky.social) has interacted with and supported open zoophiles.

We believe that while paraphiles aren't inherently abusers, participating in the wider community enables a larger cycle of abuse, even in the case of open zoophiles who consider themselves anti-contact. Paraphiles with these attractions should seek therapy from people specialized in working with paraphilias, not in communities which normalize abuse.
