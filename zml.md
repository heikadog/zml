## Information

The Laelaps labeller and its associated moderation lists for Bluesky (the Laelaps moderation lists and the Zoophile Mute List by heikadog) encompasses zoophiles and people who actively interact with or support them. This document with information and evidence is provided for transparency. View and subscribe to Laelaps: <https://laelaps.fyi>.

To be labelled, candidates should meet at least one or more of these criteria:

1. Publicly identifying as a zoophile. This includes profiles with known coded dogwhistles like the Greek letter zeta (Œ∂), the triangles and four-pointed star (‚ó§‚ú¶‚ó¢), or the Phoenician aleph (ê§Ä), or having a handle that's linked to a zoophile-centric domain name.
2. Actively interacting with open zoophiles. This includes, but is not limited to: liking or reposting posts related to, replying to, or following a large amount of open zoophiles.
3. Supporting or defending zoophiles or their associates, or creating spaces that welcome zoophiles.
4. Being publicly identified as a zoophile by a reputable whistleblower, or being found participating in conversations which advocate for or admit to zoophilic acts.

Some additional information:

- We don't label accounts based on our own personal, subjective beliefs or standards. Suspicions, feelings that an account is "probably" eligible, or otherwise inferred judgements alone do not meet our aforementioned criteria. Even if we're convinced someone is a zoophile or actively interacts with them, we don't add accounts unless we can present sufficient evidence.
- It's important to note that simply following or occasionally interacting with an alleged zoophile is not enough to be labelled. When it comes to accounts who are accused of actively interacting with zoophiles, we look for a clear, habitual pattern of one or more of the above criteria before we add them.
- Certain groups within the furry community are often falsely deemed to be zoophiles, and we don't want to contribute to that stigma. For example, even though we don't personally condone feral NSFW, creating or supporting feral NSFW does not stand on its own as sufficient evidence to deem someone a zoophile. In a similar vein, identifying as a therian does not stand on its own as sufficient evidence to deem someone a zoophile. While zoophiles have used these labels to cover for themselves, we require more concrete proof before making any judgements.
- The evidence document occasionally sources from whistleblowers who specialize in reporting on zoophilia, like ExposeTheFV and ConStaffWatch. We've gone on record to call these accounts "reputable whistleblowers," even carving out criteria in the evidence document for these accounts. We define a "reputable" whistleblower as an account with a proven track record of gathering and presenting strong, verifiable evidence related to zoophiles, such as archived snapshots of websites or screenshots they take themselves. Additionally, whistleblowers we cite in the evidence document have demonstrated a nuanced understanding of paraphilias, accurately and reliably reporting on harmful individuals while also placing an emphasis on harm reduction. And, if and when they make an error-in-fact, they have also issued retractions.
- In the event that we deem an account harmful for our users, the Laelaps team will occassionally make an executive decision to hide an account for its users, replacing the account with a Content Blocked screen. When we do this, we'll post about it on Bluesky and provide an explanation for why we hid the account in question both in the post and in the evidence document. _[This policy does not apply to accounts that violate Bluesky's Community Guidelines‚Äîwe still responsibly report those accounts.]_
- All relevant links to evidence are archived on <https://archive.today> and similar archival websites in the event that they go down or change for any reason. We also make a deliberate effort to capture our own high-quality screenshots instead of sourcing them from elsewhere.

These stipulations prevent innocent people from being unfairly labelled, as we're aware these are serious accusations that can ruin a person's reputation and should not be taken lightly.

## Evidence

> [!CAUTION]
> Some links in the Evidence section include heavily censored, but still explicit animal sexual abuse media or animal genitalia. Proceed with caution.

On November 8th, 2023, she posted feral NSFW art of Heika's fursona made to look like a zoophile as a "thanks" for creating the Zoophile Mute List, which is sexual harassment: (<https://archive.today/0YoYQ>). She also alleged that Heika was a "closeted bestialist" because they use IRL pictures of huskies to represent themselves online: (<https://archive.today/U4lnn>). And in response to Heika saying she shouldn't use her trauma to say "furries _are_ zoophiles," and, if anything, that's why zoophiles are dangerous, she sent Heika Telegram messages where she said Heika was "targeting" her, when she harassed them for listing her: (<https://archive.today/uDD4F>). _[Thera's Bluesky accounts have since been deleted, but we've decided to keep this entry in the document since this context is important to events related to the mute list and Laelaps.]_

The founders of the ski meet, Dire, Tekfox, and another fursuiter named Tuaolo, were friends with now-convicted zoosadist and pedophile Cupid the Deer, even after allegedly banning him from the meets when he got convicted: (<https://archive.today/2zn5Q>). Additionally, they've long been friends with Lycaon Victus, who has gone on record saying he's a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/0l7mq>) years after he was open about being a zoophile: (1: <https://archive.today/gSsgN> / 2: <https://archive.today/UtPd3>).

### Zoophile Supporter

1. Kaptain (@kaptain.dog) was found openly harboring zoophiles in a DM and called people holding zoophiles accountable "a witch hunt," in addition to interacting with Cenny's AD. (<https://archive.today/N7xYv>).
1. Tundru (@tundru.bsky.social/@tundruad.bsky.social) has implied that hating zoophiles is "childish," according to a reply they made to an open zoophile on Twitter: (<https://archive.today/LnsoX>), and deflected confrontations about other known zoophiles to conversations about feral porn when the actual conversation is not strictly about that. This isn't why we labelled the account, but for context, a user being called out, while not having a Bluesky account, commissioned porn of their dog being sexually abused by their OC. In this instance, this is distinguishable from normal feral porn because it referenced their real-life dog: (<https://archive.today/t99pQ>).
1. BirtyFur (@birtyfur.bsky.social) not only frequently draws profile picture commissions for zoophiles (<https://archive.today/9ccRr>), but he also followed and interacted with them on Twitter as well: (<https://archive.today/9mr8a>).
1. Kit Fox (@kit.foxpark.net/@kitfoxad.bsky.social/@furkitfox.bsky.social) is friends with several zoophiles and zoosadists. He ran a poll on who out of his followers were zoophiles or supported them: (<https://archive.today/gdKKx>), equated zoophiles to the acceptance of the LGBT community and "other fetishes": (<https://archive.today/13yLH>) and also defended zoophilia by saying there were "other perspectives": (<https://archive.today/VuRDb>).
1. Laveur (@laveur.bsky.social) was the 2018 chair of PAWcon, a furry convention in California. In his time as chairman, he allowed known zoosadist Tane and known pedophile Growly to continue attending the con in spite of the event being all-ages. When pressed on it by Dogpatch Press, he blocked them: (<https://archive.today/kpYzg>). Additionally, he had "zoophilia" listed as a "Yes" on his F-List: (<https://archive.today/runf1>).
1. DottiPink (@dottipink.bsky.social) commissioned art of zoosadism with a known zoophile, NightyBurr: (<https://archive.today/31GK1>) and filmed a video of herself using a livecasted horse dildo (a horse was sexually abused to make it): _[This tweet shows links to the content, but doesn't show media of anything specific.]_ (<https://archive.today/uP9YH>).
1. RubberAsylum (@rubberasylum.bsky.social) has a documented history of openly sympathizing with zoophiles, even asking if "hating" on zoophiles is "punishing people for a thought crime": (1: <https://archive.today/bvhV8> / 2: <https://archive.today/67gQu> / 3: <https://archive.today/Uhmye>). He follows known zoophiles on Bluesky, and up until 2018, was interacting with now-convicted zoosadist and pedophile Cupid The Deer: (<https://archive.today/uIWsS>). In 2020, he tweeted about a sexual partner of his being anti-zoophilia and talked to him about how "prolific" zoophilia is in the fetish community, with Akari responding, "I always find it a bit sad when I see people publicly shaming a fetish or lifestyle that I know that some of their close friends are into:" (<https://archive.today/LSEhv>).
1. MurrlinFox (@murrlin.bsky.social) is an open zoophile, putting it as a "Maybe" on their F-List: (<https://archive.today/roUJU>), but then saying zoophiles are being "witch hunted": (<https://archive.today/X4cDd>) and that zoophiles should make animal sexual abuse media public at conventions as a form of "protest": (<https://archive.today/wRAiC>) They also follow known zoophiles.
1. Dirt Coyote (@dirtcoyote.bsky.social) was found following the previously-mentioned animal sexual abuse account, @olHowlnGrowl, on their private AD: (<https://archive.today/rYDCV>) and infamously said "please do not forget me" in response to someone compiling screenshots of people who supported known zoophile Wild_Life: (<https://archive.today/RtNJw>). They also follow known zoophiles.
1. Kieran/Homphs (@hom.ph) moderated a Telegram group that claimed it was "zoo-friendly" and welcomed open zoophiles: (<https://archive.today/V2kXI>). Their rules directly said this: (<https://archive.today/8CKx3>).
1. Sheppfox (@sheppfox.bsky.social) was seen photographed with Tekkita and Akari in a group photo: (<https://archive.today/9o36Q>) and follows other known zoophiles like Kit Fox, Kasper Kitten, Tobi, Stormy, Stripeybutt, Cenny, and Tundru. He also frequently interacted with the AD Akari made for his dog which showed his dog's genitalia: (<https://archive.today/g9wXM>). They seemed to be roommates as recently as 2020, when Shepp and Akari bought a camper together: (<https://archive.today/JZqyl>).
1. Frosty (@frostbitefox.bsky.social) replied to a post about Kieran being a zoophile by defending them: (<https://archive.today/IM1Fv>). They've defended Kieran before, downplaying the fact that the group explicitly allowed zoophiles \*and\* IRL pictures of dogs: (<https://archive.today/zVuLE>), and when pressed on whether they're for or against animal sexual abuse, they deflected: (<https://archive.today/nxwt9>). Additionally, they asked for proof that open zoophiles abuse animals to prove a point that Birty isn't a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/1fOCE>).
1. Johabi (@johabi.bsky.social) was pictured in a group photo with Akari, Tekkita, and Shepp: (<https://archive.today/9o36Q>). He's also presumably had IRL contact with Akari's dog, from a mention of Akari's AD that he made for his dog: (<https://archive.today/zJfYF>). Additionally, he follows known zoophiles.
1. Lucian (@felicipaws.bsky.social) has previously supported known zoophile and pedophile Hypnotist Sappho, someone who has admitted to being sexually attracted to animals and groomed minors. They also follow an artist who drew Sappho fanart and followed several open zoophiles: (<https://archive.today/tPgwP>).
1. Dioxi (@co2leggyboi.bsky.social) is KierenShep's sexual partner. They've also followed and flirted with Akari (<https://archive.today/FfAyy>) and Cenny (<https://archive.today/1FyGV>), despite both of them being outed as zoophiles after 2018. They also follow known zoophiles like Kierenshep, Cenny, and Akari.
1. Furry Raiders (@furryraiders.bsky.social) are an alt-right nazifur Telegram group. Its owner, Foxler (@starfoxacefox.furryraiders.org), described dogs as "sexual beings" in a forum reply: (<https://archive.today/1HTrL>), had an account on a now-defunct animal sexual abuse forum: (<https://archive.today/vnatQ>), and lists zoophilia as a "Fave" on his F-List: (<https://archive.today/g7GnY>).
1. Hypnotist Sappho (@hypnotist-sappho.bsky.social) is an open zoophile and pedophile, but we believe this Bluesky account is LARPing as her. Initially, the account claimed to be squatting the username to prevent Sappho from reclaiming it if they tried to come back to the furry community. However, the owner of the account later deleted this clarification, effectively turning it into a troll account roleplaying as a zoophile and pedophile: (<https://archive.today/siejH>). They later made posts with captions like "rules were made to be broken (laws too):" (<https://archive.today/o8tOw>) and replies with captions like "maybe I'm her, maybe I'm not:" (<https://archive.today/W5kQk>). If you're going to squat a username so a bad actor can't take it, there should be some permanent, accessible notice of that; roleplaying as an outed zoophile and pedophile doesn't assist the anti-zoo movement in any way. TLDR: We don't believe this is the real Sappho, but the fact that this account no longer has a clarification we can point to that explicitly says they're not the real Sappho can potentially lead to real harm and confusion.
1. moteyote/motoryote (@moteyote.bsky.social) defended wild\_\_life, but additionally twisted several academic studies on CSAM into applying to all paraphilias and citing studies that ended up not supporting his claims anyway, as evident from this thread by @ExposeTheFV on Twitter: (<https://archive.today/O4i2C>).
1. Ashe FoxD (@ashefoxd.bsky.social) is dating Thera, an open zoophile.
1. MidnightMakers (@midnightmakers.ca) is FrosstFursuits, a fursuit maker who has longstanding ties to Cenny, a known zoophile. Announcement of the rebrand: (<https://archive.today/IgpLW>). Archive of carnalcove's tweet about her, with original images: (<https://archive.today/NAMHN>). She also defended a known zoophile, wild\_\_life, when she admitted to being a zoophile and having taken part in animal sexual abuse: (<https://archive.today/U6QrI>).
1. Jamie Sharp (@jamiesharp.bsky.social/@yiffkitty.bsky.social) openly sympathizes with Cenny, a known zoophile. We've archived a callout on Jamie and the original poster's DM conversation with Jamie here: (<https://archive.today/UvWsl>). Additionally, they had Zoophilia as a "Yes" on their F-List as recently as 2021: (<https://archive.today/1ANkh>).
1. Kat (@fictofamilyguyfan.from.wtf/@ficto-kats-blocks.bsky.social) is a "zoo ally," according to their bio.
1. In 2015, Xy/Knot A Good Dog (@badfuckingdog.bsky.social) said on their Ask.fm that they "wouldn't stop [an animal from having sex with them] if they started it:" (<https://archive.today/SqQ5l>). They are also mutuals with multiple open zoophiles on Twitter. In 2024, they replied to an open zoophile with a privated account, meaning they're mutuals and they had to see her profile to request to follow it and respond to her reply: (<https://archive.today/yxk0J>). Someone in Xy's Telegram group chat reached out to us with the knowledge that the zoophile in question joined, introduced herself in the chat saying Xy vouched for her, and was promptly kicked because of the zeta in her bio. Later, in the group chat, Xy said people were "making stuff up about [them]," and that "somebody was targeting [their] group members to try to upset them [or Xy]."
1. utsuho (@suffernofools.bsky.social) says in their bio that they support zoophiles.
1. Slightly Furry (@slightlyfurry.bsky.social) was named by ConStaffWatch as willingly associating with zoophiles like K0mpy and Ari: (<https://archive.today/wVfSb>). K0mpy, an owner of the bar Slightly Furry owns, admitted to liking animal sexual abuse media: (<https://archive.today/YiBdW>), made porn with Cenny: (<https://archive.today/J40Z1>), and is married to Ari, who has a zoophile pride sticker on his phone: (<https://archive.today/Z1jLG>).
1. Signless/OllieOops/ArtsyPawz (@trolljegus.bsky.social/@xenocanidae.bsky.social) has interacted with and supported open zoophiles. In addition to interacting with people who openly identify as zoophiles, they've also suggested multiple times across multiple accounts that people who identify as zoophiles are not abusers, spanning as far back as September of 2023. We believe that while paraphiles aren't inherently abusers, participating in the wider community enables a larger cycle of abuse, even in the case of open zoophiles who consider themselves anti-contact. Paraphiles with these attractions should seek therapy from people specialized in working with paraphilias, not in communities which normalize abuse. Full statement with screenshots of evidence: (<https://bsky.app/profile/heika.dog/post/3kutbudbvj27f>).
1. Shadow (@closingdistance.bsky.social) supports open zoophiles. In particular, they reposted a meme from a zoophile with the caption, "When all your friends have [the Greek zeta] in their username": (<https://archive.today/gXNl7>).
1. Mating and Playing (@mating.bsky.social) interacts with zoophiles, and has made several statements in support of zoophilia, like supporting an "evolution of the zoo community," pushing the idea that an animal can consent to sex with humans: (<https://archive.today/AmhkZ>).
1. Exotic Erotics (@exotic-erotics.bsky.social/@exotic-erotics-ad.bsky.social) is a manufacturer of sex toys. It uses lifecasting to manufacture its toys, which involves directly modeling the toys after an a real animal's genitals by stimulating and 3D scanning the animal's genitals. We find this to be unethical.
1. Monody (@rancore202.bsky.social) supports open zoophiles, notably including the Greek zeta dogwhistle for zoophiles in their bio as people who are "welcome".
1. Kroobs/Rey/W0LFSIN (@kr00bs.com/@reyw0lf.bsky.social/@w0lfsin.bsky.social) has gone on record to say zoophiles and pedophiles "deserve community:" (<https://archive.today/QKRgj>).
1. The "Kero the Wolf" (@kerothewolf.bsky.social/@radiancewolf.bsky.social) Bluesky account appears to be a parody account, but we're still adding and labelling as a Zoophile Supporter, as there's no indication this account is a parody of any kind. _[Note: Edited to include a related Kero alias.]_
1. Couger.silverpaws (@couger.bsky.social) follows open zoophiles. Additionally, their bio says they're "LGBTQZ friendly," where the Z is implied to stand for "zoophiles."
1. grey (@hydroblade.bsky.social) expressed support for zoophiles: (<https://archive.today/fVDyw>).
1. Love the Dragon (@lovethedog.bsky.social) said zoophilia is "gravely misunderstood:" (<https://archive.today/WGPNI>).
1. Marisa (@marisavanima.bsky.social) supports zoophiles, writing "Zoo pride!" under a zoophile's post: (<https://archive.today/91EJO>), and replying to other zoophiles: (1: <https://archive.today/0DGLc> / 2: <https://archive.today/fitQ6> / 3: <https://archive.today/AvX5w>).

### Outed Zoophile

1. _[CW for realistic depictions of animal genitalia and explicit nudes. The Telegram link provided here also has screen recordings of select tweets in addition to screenshots.]_ AkariHusky (@akarihusky.feral.army) has a large amount of evidence against him, most of which can be viewed here: (<https://t.me/AkariHuskyZoophile>). Along with directly supporting zoophilia and being an open zoophile for years, Akari also had an AD dedicated to his dog where he posted explicit animal sexual abuse media of the dog. In 2015, he said in a reply that he "wouldn't wish being zoo upon anyone," direct confirmation that he is a zoophile.
1. _[CW in the first link for explicit nudes and censored animal sexual abuse media.]_ Among other actions, like calling holding people accountable for zoophilia an "SJW crusade," and liking a post on his AD which linked to a peer-to-peer mirror of animal sexual abuse media in 2013: (<https://twitter.com/itsjustathingy/status/1406230343426977793>), Cenny (@cenny.bsky.social/@cennyad.bsky.social) had the zeta symbol in his bio in 2016: (<https://archive.today/mHg4g>) and was caught liking explicit animal sexual abuse media on his AD: (<https://archive.today/r23Vm>). In addition, he was explicitly mentioned to be a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks in 2017: (<https://archive.today/zlA4O>).
1. Papa Rhino (@paparhino.dad/@papamord.bsky.social) is a zoophile. Heika worked on an outing about him with reputable whistleblower ExposeTheFV, linking him to his alt, JDonk (@zooeydonk.bsky.social) _[Now suspended, but leaving here for reference.]_, and showing he's a zoophile (and has publicly interacted with minors as young as 14): (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1730851018416771097>). He even liked a reply to JDonk's tweet _about_ JDonk being Rhino: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1730851024393691197>).
1. Simba, the owner of furry community Discord server Furry Valley (@furryvalley.bsky.social), is a documented zoosadist: (<https://archive.today/24IAU>) and has been documented following zoophiles on the main Furry Valley Twitter as recently as 2021: (<https://archive.today/PBv9o>).
1. Matuska (@matuska.bsky.social) has publicly stated they don't condone IRL zoophilia on their feral account, but they listed themselves as a zoophile in 2019: (<https://archive.today/NtDFK>).
1. Zrcalo (@zrcalo.bsky.social/@drachenvoid.bsky.social) is a documented zoosadist, and has publicly admitted to killing birds because they were "pretty for taxidermy" when he was 16: (<https://archive.today/zf1jf>). _[The tweet itself is a video of a Twitter Space. To access it, visit the link at the top of the archive page.]_ He also sent a minor "consensual beast porn": (<https://archive.today/ZUfgc>). And made a tutorial on how to taxidermy birds under the name "foxycrush": (<https://archive.today/ZUfgc>). Additionally, he has a track record of interfering with zoophilia investigations to protect abusers: (<https://archive.today/xZz5D>).
1. HateEven (@hateeven.bsky.social) outed themselves as a zoophile in a zoophilic Telegram group, and has a history of drawing art for open zoophiles: (<https://archive.today/QxLiC>).
1. TechRoo (@techroo.bsky.social) has had public accounts on several zoophilic websites (his Twitter is linked because the mask on both accounts matches up:) (<https://archive.today/JbK7f>).
1. Danger Doberman (@dangerdoberman.bsky.social) was convicted of 200 counts of sexually assaulting an animal and 200 counts of aggravated animal abuse in 2009, admitting to sexually abusing his dog over 400 times: (<https://archive.today/aqd6n>). He also had an account on a now-defunct animal sexual abuse forum: (<https://archive.today/Ltjgt>) and was charged with attempted second-degree homicide in 2016: (<https://archive.today/EnkWg>).
1. Tigeris Tiger (@tigeristiger.bsky.social) had an account he created in 2006 on a now-defunct animal sexual abuse forum where he explicitly said he was a zoophile "since age 12": (<https://archive.today/JSkLy>).
1. Ashley Fox (@afoxofficial.bsky.social) had an account on a now-defunct animal sexual abuse forum under the name "lilpup": (<https://archive.today/6kxul>) and their F-List also lined up with this name despite not listing zoophilia on it directly: (<https://archive.today/WgC3H>). Additionally, while Kero got outed, Ashley roomed with Tigeris: (<https://archive.today/BJ67e>).
1. Stripeybutt (@stripeybutt.bsky.social) had an account on a now-defunct animal sexual abuse forum under the name "Streakthetiger": (<https://archive.today/euCvd>) Their LiveJournal showed a tiger with green hair under this alias: (<https://archive.today/tt1a>) and their FurAffinity shows the same tiger with a different hair color: _[CW for NSFW content.]_ (<https://archive.today/VWvNV>).
1. Cojo (@cojo.feral.army) follows known zoophiles and lists Zoophilia as a "Fave" on their F-List: (<https://archive.today/aLl5w>).
1. Vitai Slade (@vitai.bsky.social) is a zoophile. Most of the evidence against him is in a publicly-accessible Telegram channel, showing he was active in zoophile group chats dating as far back as 2014: _[CW for mentions of animal sexual abuse and an uncensored screenshot of animal genitalia.]_ (<https://t.me/+zFN1GrZG85BiM2Mx>). He has been on record stating his wife is "a zoo," and said a picture of a dog's genitalia was "delicious." Along with screenshots of evidence and forwarded messages from Vitai, there are messages from bots in the channel that corroborate timestamps.

1. Hakan (@hakanwillnom.bsky.social) is an alt of Kero The Wolf, a known necrozoosadist with ties to SnakeThing and Tane. Two threads in particular proved that this was actually Kero: (1: <https://twitter.com/KeroArchive/status/1756107775568908601> / 2: <https://twitter.com/DogpatchPress/status/1756253402492023255>).
1. Paradox Wolf (@ctcwired.paradoxwolf.info) tweeted about zoophilia several times from 2014 to 2017: (<https://archive.today/5IG26>), tweeted about being "an ally" in 2017: (<https://archive.today/ushQa>), and as far back as 2018 they had it in their AD's bio: (<https://archive.today/zgEg3>). They also condemned calling Kero a zoosadist: (<https://archive.today/ilWtO>). Additional screenshots of Paradox being an apologist for zoophilia: (<https://archive.today/4PQ0t>).
1. Anubis Coyote (@yotepa.ws) was mentioned in the zoosadist leaks by SnakeThing as being a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). Under his direction, he let a dog mount him: (<https://archive.today/6ySOP>). Additionally, in 2024, he liked a post from open zoophile Huskeee about non-verbal communication (i.e., a way to justify them sexually abusing dogs): (<https://archive.today/YklLL>).
1. Philly Satark (@purplepawsky.bsky.social/@purple-slutsky.com) was mentioned as being a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). They were additionally found to have participated in another zoophile Telegram group: (<https://archive.today/rKfr2>). The person who made their suit, jessefrost / frosstfursuits, openly associates with Cenny as well (this is a thread): (<https://twitter.com/carnalcove/status/1500755885081120770>).
1. Stormy (@stormycat.xyz) openly admitted to being a zoophile and having sex with animals: (<https://archive.today/jGTch>) and was named in the zoosadist leaks by SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). When they were called out on it in 2018, they downplayed what happened as "[watching] the community take a shit on you over what you did as a teenager" and said the fandom was toxic (<https://archive.today/Q2qMu>). In addition, Cenny defended Stormy publicly after Cenny was criticized for associating with him: (<https://archive.today/Lswki>).
1. Tekkita (@ak1tap0wer.bsky.social) was implicated in the zoosadist leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and was part of a plot to assault someone who pressed charges against their associates: (<https://dogpatch.press/2019/09/16/crime-ring-zoosadist>). Tekkita dated Cupid the Deer, a convicted zoosadist and pedophile: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction>). He claimed he was going to borrow a dog from Cupid and discussed possessing "gorey rough videos" with known zoosadist SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/Mcv6e>). Additionally, he was seen in 2019 hanging out with Akari, apparently his boyfriend at the time: (<https://twitter.com/forgifuzzbutt/status/1114218195907416065>) _[Tekkita's Bluesky account has since been deleted, but we've decided to keep this entry in the document since Tekkita is an important figure in the zoosadist leaks.]_
1. Rai Dawg (@raidawghusky.bsky.social) dated Cupid the Deer, a convicted zoosadist and pedophile, for over three years: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction/>). And in 2022, he defended Cupid in court: (<https://archive.today/PGpA0>).
   > In an earlier version of this document, we were of the opinion that Mr. Bitchtits was Rai, and another common theory in anti-zoophile circles was that Mr. Bitchtits was a shared account. However, external research instead confirmed that the person running the Mr. Bitchtits account arranged to make animal sexual abuse media, that there was a matching video of evidence including Tekkita's suit, and the date the file was created is the day after he discussed borrowing a dog from Cupid in the logs. Therefore, we've deduced that Tekkita is the sole owner of the account, _not_ Rai. However, due to his proximity to Cupid and other known zoophiles, we've decided to keep Rai labelled.
1. postaldog94 (@grummanllv.com/@postaldog94.bsky.social) is a registered sex offender who conspired to assault puppies with SnakeThing. These logs also connect him with Akari and Tekkita: _[CW for NSFL conversations.]_ (<https://archive.today/J8KqY>).

### Hidden

> [!NOTE]
> This section includes accounts Laelaps has hidden for its users. Because it entirely blocks accounts, we rarely use it unless we find an account harmful to the network or our users and the account hasn't been actioned on by Bluesky themselves.

1. Furry Valley, a group run by a notorious zoosadist, created a Bluesky account modeled after "The Furry Detectives," a docuseries about the 2018 zoosadism leaks. This account has nothing to do with the series and intends to mislead people into joining Furry Valley. We've hidden it for Laelaps users. _[See our entry on Simba.]_
